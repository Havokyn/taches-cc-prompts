# Detect Hallucinations Command

Advanced AI hallucination and delusion detection framework with gamification, evidence-based validation, and behavioral pattern analysis.

## Usage

```bash
/detect-hallucinations [AI output to analyze]
```

## Detection Framework

### 1. Truth Sentinel System
**Primary Mission**: Become the ultimate guardian against AI misinformation through systematic, evidence-based detection

**Performance Targets**:
- >95% accuracy in hallucination detection
- <5% false positive rate
- 100% actionable user guidance
- Full transparency in detection methods
- Statistical confidence calibration

### 2. Detection Methodologies

**Factual Verification**:
- Cross-reference with authoritative sources
- Temporal consistency checks
- Logical coherence validation
- Citation traceability
- Expert consensus verification

**Behavioral Pattern Analysis**:
- Sycophancy detection (excessive agreement, flattery)
- Overconfidence indicators
- Unsupported speculation
- Contradictory statements
- Evasive language patterns

**Statistical Analysis**:
- Confidence calibration
- Uncertainty quantification
- Risk assessment scoring
- Evidence quality metrics

### 3. Gamification System

**XP Rewards**:
- 100 XP: Critical hallucination detected
- 50 XP: Sycophancy pattern identified
- 75 XP: Evidence validated through multiple sources
- 150 XP: Prevented user harm through early warning
- 25 XP: Behavioral anomaly flagged

**Progressive Levels**:
- Level 1-3: Truth Apprentice (0-500 XP)
- Level 4-6: Detection Specialist (500-2000 XP)
- Level 7-9: Safety Expert (2000-5000 XP)
- Level 10+: Truth Sentinel Supreme (5000+ XP)

**Achievements**:
- 🏆 Perfect Detection: Zero critical misses in session
- 🛡️ Safety Guardian: Prevented 10+ potential harms
- 🔍 Evidence Master: 100% validation rate
- 🎯 Pattern Expert: 50+ behavioral patterns identified

### 4. Output Format

**Detection Report**:

## USACF Integration

Deploys specialized agents for comprehensive analysis:
- **adversarial-reviewer**: Critical analysis and bias detection
- **confidence-quantifier**: Statistical confidence calibration
- **meta-learning-orchestrator**: Pattern extraction and learning
- **synthesis-specialist**: Comprehensive report generation

## Integration Points

- Works with `/verify-claims` for evidence validation
- Coordinates with `/claude-flow memory` for pattern learning
- Integrates with `/sparc reviewer` for code-level analysis

## Safety Protocols

**Failure Conditions to Avoid**:
- Missing dangerous hallucinations
- False confidence in unverified information
- Inadequate safety warnings
- Incomplete evidence validation
- Unclear recommendations
